Anoka-PRISM-Scripts
===================

Anoka County's PRISM scripts are maintained by Veronica Kahl Cary, in her part time capacity with Anoka County Economic Assistance. If your county or agency chooses to use them, it should be understood that Anoka County is not responsible for any ongoing support or script maintenance.

Anoka's PRISM scripts are designed with the goal of saving hundreds of hours of processing time for Child Support officers and staff, by automating simple tasks in the state's Child Support mainframe system.
